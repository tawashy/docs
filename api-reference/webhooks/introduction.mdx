# Webhooks

Webhooks allow operators to **receive real-time notifications** whenever certain events occur within the Riyadh Parking system. Instead of constantly polling the API for updates, webhooks provide an efficient way to stay informed about critical changes.

<Info>
Webhooks enable **event-driven automation**, allowing your system to respond instantly to parking-related updates.

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Subscribe to Webhooks**: Once onboarded, operators can access the **Operator Portal** to configure webhook subscriptions.
2. **Receive Event Notifications**: When an event occurs (e.g., a new violation, ticket validation, or site capacity update), a `POST` request is sent to your webhook endpoint.
3. **Process the Webhook Data**: Your system should verify and process the incoming event payload to trigger appropriate actions.

## Expected Webhook Behavior

- **Delivery Format**: Webhooks are sent as `POST` requests with JSON payloads.
- **Security**: Webhook payloads are signed to ensure authenticity.
- **Retries**: If a webhook delivery fails, the system will retry multiple times before marking it as failed.
- **Event Types**: Available webhook events can be explored via the **Operator Portal** after service activation.

## Handling Webhooks

To process incoming webhooks:
1. **Expose an HTTPS endpoint** that can accept `POST` requests.
2. **Verify the webhook signature** to ensure authenticity.
3. **Acknowledge the request with a `200 OK`** response to prevent unnecessary retries.

### Example Webhook Payload
```json
{
  "event": "ticket.issued",
  "data": {
    "ticketId": "12345",
    "plateNumber": "ABC123",
    "zoneId": "zone-001",
    "issuedAt": "2025-03-09T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Verify webhook signatures** before processing events to prevent unauthorized requests.
- **Use idempotency** when handling webhooks to avoid duplicate processing.
- **Log webhook events** for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Ensure high availability** of your webhook endpoint to receive updates reliably.

## Next Steps
- Set up webhook subscriptions in the **Operator Portal**.
- Implement webhook handling logic in your backend.
- Review **[Security Best Practices](../../development/security.mdx)** to secure your integration.
