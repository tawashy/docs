# Ticketing Webhook

Riyadh Parking provides **real-time ticketing and invoicing updates** to operators when a ticket is generated via the mobile app or website. This allows operators to **track transactions** and **automate processing** without polling the API.

<Info>
  To receive ticket and invoice data, operators must **register a valid endpoint** through the **Operator Portal**.
</Info>

## 1️⃣ Ticket & Invoice Data Structure

Each time a parking transaction occurs, Riyadh Parking sends a **POST request** to the operator's webhook endpoint with the following payload.

### **Invoice Schema**

```json
{
  "invoiceTime": "2025-03-09T12:00:00Z",
  "invoiceNumber": "INV-123456",
  "vatNumber": "300123456700003",
  "invoiceTotalAmount": 100.00,
  "invoiceTax": 15.00,
  "invoiceAmount": 85.00,
  "paymentMethod": "MADA",
  "transactionRef": "TXN-987654"
}
```

### **Ticket Schema**

```json
{
  "id": "ticket-uuid",
  "parkingZone": "zone-001",
  "transactionTime": "2025-03-09T12:05:00Z",
  "startTime": "2025-03-09T10:00:00Z",

    "invoiceNumber": "INV-123456",
    "vatNumber": "300123456700003",
    "invoiceTotalAmount": 100.00,
    "invoiceTax": 15.00,

    "paymentMethod": "MADA",
    "transactionRef": "TXN-987654"
  },
  "ticketType": "STANDARD",
  "isSaudiPlate": true
}
```

## 2️⃣ How to Handle Incoming Requests

* **Expose an HTTPS endpoint** that accepts `POST` requests.

* **Verify the request payload** to ensure data integrity.

* **Acknowledge receipt** by responding with a `200 OK` status.

### **Example Endpoint Implementation (Node.js/Express)**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/parking/ticket", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Received Ticket Data:", req.body);
  res.status(200).send({ message: "Ticket received successfully" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

## 3️⃣ Expected Responses

Your system must respond to each request with the appropriate HTTP status code.

| Status Code                 | Description                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `200 OK`                    | Request received successfully. |
| `400 Bad Request`           | Invalid payload structure.     |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected processing error.   |

<Warning>
  If your system fails to acknowledge the request, retries will be attempted before marking it as failed.
