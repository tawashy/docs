description: Learn how developers can authenticate and secure API access for Riyadh Parking.
---

## Overview

The **Riyadh Parking API** requires authentication for all API interactions. As a developer, you must obtain and use access tokens to securely communicate with the system. This ensures that only authorized applications can interact with parking services. 

## Authentication Workflow

1. **Obtain API Credentials**: You need a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, provided by the Riyadh Parking admin team.

2. **Request an Access Token**: Use the credentials to generate an authentication token.

3. **Include the Token in API Requests**: Pass the token in the `Authorization` header of each request.

4. **Refresh Tokens Periodically**: Ensure continued access by handling token expiration.

## Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Getting an Access Token

Use the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to request an access token. Ensure this request is made securely from a backend server.

### 2️⃣ Using the Token

Include the token in every API request as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### 3️⃣ Handling Token Expiry

Tokens expire after a set duration. Implement a mechanism to refresh them before expiration.

## Best Practices for Developers

* **Never expose credentials**: Store them securely on the backend.

* **Use HTTPS**: Always send API requests over a secure connection.

* **Implement retry logic**: Handle token expiration gracefully to avoid service disruptions.

## Next Steps

Once authenticated, proceed with creating tickets, report violations, update parking occupancy. Check the [Full API Reference](./api-reference/introduction) for more details.
