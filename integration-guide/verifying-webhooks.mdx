At Riyadh Parking, we use **Svix** to send webhooks. As our operator, it's important that you verify incoming webhook requests to ensure they are legitimate. Below is the official guide for **manual verification** of signatures.

## Headers Sent with Webhooks

Each webhook call includes the following headers:

| Header            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `svix-id`         | Unique message ID. Stays the same if the webhook is resent.                 |
| `svix-timestamp`  | UNIX timestamp (in seconds).                                                |
| `svix-signature`  | Base64 encoded list of HMAC signatures. Multiple versions may be included.  |

## How to Construct the Signed Content

To construct the signed content, concatenate the message components using a `.` (dot):

```js
const signedContent = `${svix_id}.${svix_timestamp}.${body}`;
```

- `svix_id`: from the `svix-id` header
- `svix_timestamp`: from the `svix-timestamp` header
- `body`: the raw body of the request

> ⚠️ Do **not** modify the request body before verification. Even small changes will invalidate the signature.

## How to Compute the Expected Signature

Svix uses HMAC with SHA-256. You need to:

1. Take your signing secret (remove the `whsec_` prefix).
2. Decode the base64 portion.
3. HMAC the `signedContent` using the decoded secret.

### Node.js Example

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');

const signedContent = `${svix_id}.${svix_timestamp}.${body}`;
const secret = "whsec_5WbX5kEWLlfzsGNjH64I8lOOqUB6e8FH";

// Decode the secret (strip "whsec_" prefix)
const secretBytes = Buffer.from(secret.split('_')[1], "base64");

const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secretBytes)
  .update(signedContent)
  .digest('base64');

console.log(signature);
```

## Matching the Signature

The `svix-signature` header contains a space-delimited list of versioned signatures, e.g.:

```
v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE= v2,abcdef==
```

To validate:

- Remove the version prefix (`v1,`, `v2,` etc.).
- Compare the base64-encoded result with your computed signature.
- Use **constant-time comparison** to avoid timing attacks.

---

## Verifying the Timestamp

Always compare the `svix-timestamp` against your server’s current time.

- Reject the webhook if the timestamp is outside an acceptable window (e.g., ±5 minutes).
- This prevents replay/timestamp attacks.

---

## Example Signature

```text
secret     = 'whsec_plJ3nmyCDGBKInavdOK15jsl'
payload    = '{"event_type":"ping","data":{"success":true}}'
msg_id     = 'msg_loFOjxBNrRLzqYUf'
timestamp  = '1731705121'

// Expected signature
signature  = 'v1,rAvfW3dJ/X/qxhsaXPOyyCGmRKsaKWcsNccKXlIktD0='
```

> If the timestamp is outdated, verification will fail — this is expected.
